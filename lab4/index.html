		<p> The following is the pseudocode of our Uno card game program:</p>
		<pre><code>
	// Generate Uno deck (Cards 1-9, red, yellow, green, or blue)
	// Give each player 7 cards
	// Place remaining cards face down to create a draw pile
	// Turn over top card of the draw pile to begin discard pile
	// Randomly select player to take first turn
	// Check if player hand has any playable cards
	    // If no
	        // Player draws one card from draw pile
	        // If drawn card can be played, add to discard pile
	        // Next playerâ€™s turn, repeat from Step 6
	    // If yes
	        // Continue to next steps
	// Ask player which card to play (user input)
	// Validate user input
	    // If card is same number OR same color
	        // Place card in discard pile
	        // If player has one card remaining in hand
	            // Player must say UNO!
	            // If another player says UNO! before current Player
	                // Player must draw two cards from draw pile
	        // If player has no cards remaining in hand
	            // Player WINS
	            // TERMINATE GAME
	        // Next player's turn, repeat from Step 6
	    // Else
	        // Reject card
	        // Ask player for another card
	// Next player's turn, repeat from Step 6
