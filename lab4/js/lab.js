// Give each player 7 cards
// Place remaining cards face down to create a draw pile
// Turn over top card of the draw pile to begin discard pile
// Randomly select player to take first turn
// Check if player hand has any playable cards
    // If no
        // Player draws one card from draw pile
        // If drawn card can be played, add to discard pile
        // Next playerâ€™s turn, repeat from Step 6
    // If yes
        // Continue to next steps
// Ask player which card to play (user input)

    // If card is same number OR same color
        // Place card in discard pile
        // If player has one card remaining in hand
            // Player must say UNO!
            // If another player says UNO! before current Player
