	<h1>Lab 3 File Structures</h1>
	<p>The purpose of this lab was to learn file structures. This means to know how to link files through knowing the path to and from certain directories.</p>
	<h2>Challenges</h2>
	<p>The hardest part of this lab for me was resizing the image. For some reason, even when I assigned my img a specific id and changed the modified it in CSS, <br>
		the image would not resize. The problem ended up being that the path to the image was slightly wrong. After solving this, everything was smooth sailing. </p>
	<h2>Results</h2>
	<p>My web page turned out well and everything looks the way it should.</p>
